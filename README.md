<h1>Dynamic ARP Inspection</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will configure DHCP snooping.<br/>
<br/>

Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is another security feature commonly implemented on network switches to protect against ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing attacks. ARP spoofing involves an attacker sending falsified ARP messages over a local area network, with the aim of associating their MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate network device. This can lead to various security threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker intercepts or alters communication between two parties.<br/>

The purpose of Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is to mitigate ARP spoofing attacks by inspecting ARP packets as they traverse the network
